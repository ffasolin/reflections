When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to work with other people on the same project and to make sure you don't lose it if device is lost

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    other people might be working on different files and or altering the same files you’re working on and pushing automatically would overwrite those changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks will copy a repository from a github account to another
    clone will copy a repository from a github account to a local computer or from local to local
    branches will, in either github or local create a separate commit path that can be merged or not afterwards   	

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you’re able to diff with current commit and merge without losing any progress to then push

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    everyone would have files locally and give each other updates of changes, it would be a mess

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    branch - when testing a new feature or something you're not sure will work etc
    master - whilst continuing to write new code or when fixing bugs
    The branch can be descarted if doesn't work or merged if it does, but might cause conflicts if other people are working on the master
